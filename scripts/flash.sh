Port name usually has the following pattern, where X is number representing the port:
    * Linux: ttyACMX (or ttyUSBX)
    * macOS: cu.usbmodemXXX
    * WSL: ttySX (where X corresponds with COMX port name from Windows)
If unsure, open Arduino IDE and check where your Arduino as an programmer is connected to under Tools/Port.
